# TF_TORCH_JAX
Of the many publicly available ML/DL frameworks I personally prefer using TensorFlow mostly because of the convenience Keras API provides. Recently however, I have seen the necessity to study additional frameworks such as Torch or Jax/Flax for the sake of my flexibility in learning and implementations.   

This repository will be recording my week long private programming session. I am planning to present 5 diffenent projects starting from simple classification problems to complex NLP modeling in all three frameworks(Tensorflow,Torch,Jax/Flax). Hopefully, I might be able to introduce my own implementation of a byte-to-byte Korean language model written in Jax/Flax by the end of the week.
